# Project__1
This project aims to investigate the factors influencing national happiness and trends over time. Key research questions include whether a country's happiness score correlates with its GDP per capita and if predicted life expectancy impacts happiness. Additionally, we will determine the happiest continent based on global happiness score. Furthermore, we will analyse happiness trends from 2018 to 2024 for specific countries like Australia, Spain, China, and the USA. By collecting and analysing relevant data on economic indicators, happiness metrics, and life expectancy, this study will provide insights into the socio-economic drivers of happiness and how they evolve over time across different regions.

# Conclusion

In conclusion, economic factors significantly influence national well-being, with higher GDP per capita correlating moderately with higher happiness scores. There's potential correlation between unemployment rate and happiness, while a positive link exists between predicted life expectancy and happiness. Oceania had the highest median happiness score compared to the other continents. The COVID-19 pandemic didn't significantly alter global happiness scores, though China appeared to score a higher happiness score after COVID-19.
